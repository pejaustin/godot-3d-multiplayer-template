# Godot 3D Multiplayer Template
A very basic multiplayer template set in a 3D world. Use this as a starting point for your game or a quick way to prototype functionality.

- Synchronizes player movement and animations: Idle, Walk/Run, Jump, and Fall 
- Uses [Netfox](https://github.com/foxssake/netfox) for lag compensation
- Netfox's [RewindableStateMachine](https://foxssake.github.io/netfox/netfox.extras/guides/rewindable-state-machine/) for state based movement
- Basic main menu
- Can run as [host or dedicated server](https://youtu.be/jgJuX04cq7k)
